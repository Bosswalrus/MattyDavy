# MattyDavy
A fun little side project created for educational purposes.

*MattyDavy* is a very simple instruction set with no conditional instructions, this does not represent my real work; this project is pretty much a joke.

**Credits**
- Instruction Set/Documentation: *Matthew* (CntKillMe)
- Lua-sided *MattyDavy* VM, Assembler, and Disassembler: *David* (CeaselessSoul)
- C-sided *MattyDavy* VM: *Matthew*

Eventually I might created a C-sided *MattyDavy* Assembler and Disassembler. None of these scripts are safe in any way, it was put together as a quick, 1 hour project and will proably never be updated again.

A more realistic project.
